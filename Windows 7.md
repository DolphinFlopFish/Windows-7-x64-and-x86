#Windows
Windows 7 was the next big update to Windows Vista and was better than ever it came with: Windows Aero, Windows Media Center
and many more! Microsoft made this version of Windows to follow up Windows Vista after Windows 7 there was Windows 8/8.1 and
Now Windows 10. Most Liked Windows 7 after Windows Vista because Vista was Slow, Windows 7 came with better performace, updated
taskbar buttons and not a Windows XP Looking theme (Some parts of Vista were like XP). Your thanks, DirectPCSOFTWARE
