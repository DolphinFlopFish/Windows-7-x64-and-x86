# Info
I will add the x86 and x64 .iso file together, since the Windows 7 DVD only lets me install x86 x64 software, I will add Windows 7 Ultimate CDâ€™s Separate so x64 is in one and x86 is in the other. This article is also in the issues menu. The real article is that installing this in virtualbox or vmware will need a VHD type hard disk and 1024MB for RAM and over (0-1000MB will not work). To boot from this make a bootable USB or CD. A good app for making bootable USB's is Rufus (Link:rufus.ie)I do not know about CD's. A good app for making bootable USB's on Mac is Etcher (Link:balena.io/etcher/). (You can always see Youtube Videos if don't know what to do!) WARNING: To activate Windows 7 you will need a valid product key, if you don't have one you can search one up (In VirtualBox or VMware you can take a snapshot and save the VM) or else you need to buy or get a valid product key. This will take up about 16GB (32bit) and 20GB (64bit). Other Software will be added to this GitHub channel.   Your thanks, DirectPCSOFTWARE
